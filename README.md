# TD-Challenges
We wanted to get to know the diverse range of participants a little better. Since we didn't have time to talk to every person, we were inspired by the task to create a personalized recommendation for every person. Through the data, we learned a bit more about each person's background, their interests, experiences, and their hopes for the future. 

We also learned a lot more about NLP and search matching.
