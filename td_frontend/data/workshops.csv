We will start with a refresher on linear regression and represent regression as an “optimization” problem. Next, we’ll show how machine learning is a fancy term for model fitting. A model is a function with parameters and variables. “Fitting” is the process of picking the right parameter values. I’ll show you how sklearn can be used to fit a model.  Next, I’ll introduce Neural Networks and how we can represent linear regression as a NN.",ML,1
TD 2020,Reinforcement Learning,"RL, stock, trading, games, robotics, deep learning, advanced, machine learning, neural networks, policy","Beyond supervised and unsupervised learning, did you know there is another form of ML called reinforcement learning (RL)? RL is a rapidly developing field of ML that learns to maximize its reward by choosing actions in its environment. Reinforcement learning has been successful at playing complex games such as DOTA and even beating human experts.
In this workshop, we’ll cover what you need to get started in reinforcement learning including some basic structure, theory and algorithms. We’ll finish by showing how reinforcement learning can be used for the stock prediction challenge!",DL,3

Bootcamp 2020,Model Interpretability,"feature importance plots, partial dependence plots, tree interpreters, explainability, black-box","In this session on model interpretability, we will do a deep dive into ways to analyze why machine learning models make certain decisions.
But why is model interpretability so important? Imagine that the CDC develops an antiviral drug that is speculated to be a cure for the Covid-19 virus. Based on a few trials, the CDC develops a predictive model that can correctly predict the success of the drug on a new patient 90 percent of the time.
But, is just knowing the success rate enough to trust the model without caring about why it made a certain decision? What if the drug has serious negative side-effects on people with heart diseases?
In this session, we will cover a few of the necessary tools such as feature importance plots, partial dependence plots, and tree interpreters to answer such questions. We will walk through the code associated with these concepts on a dataset from Kaggle.",ML,2

That word makes me think of cowboys for some reason. But seriously, finding good data and getting it into a pandas data-frame can actually be half the battle. I'll make sure you guys know how to find and load a dataset of your choice and do some quick analysis.
We'll then hop over to data visualization and cover the basics of seaborne. Yeah... we gotta start with the basics. But trust me; with the basics of this tool under your belt, you'll look like a data science wizard since you'll be able to visualize most, if not all, of the data sets you encounter.
